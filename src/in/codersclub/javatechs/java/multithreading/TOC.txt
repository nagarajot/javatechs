   Create a thread class, FirstThread by extending the 
   Thread class.
   Create a thread class, SecondThread by implementing 
   the Runnable interface.
   Create a class called as MainThread, and start
   the threads FirstThread and SecondThread.
   Observe the results.
   
   FirstThread.java
   SecondThread.java
   MainThread.java
   
   
   Creating Multiple Threads
   -------------------------
   
   Create a thread class, MyThread by implementing 
   Runnable interface. Pass the name as the parameter
   to the constructor. Start the thread within the 
   constructor.
   Print the properties of the thread such as
   name, priority and thread group.
   
   Create three threads with names One, Two and Three.
   
   MyThread.java
   MyThreadDemo.java
   
   Main Thread 
   -------------
   When the Java program starts execution, one thread begins 
   running immediately.
   
   This is called as the main thread.
   
   Main thread is important for 2 reasons.
   
   1. It is the parent thread for all other threads.
   2. Generally, it should be the last thread to finish
      execution.
      
   Thread class has a static method called as currentThread().   

   public static Thread currentThread()
   
   3 thread properties are displayed.
   namely, name, priority, threadgroup
   
   By default, thread name will be main, thread priority
   will be 5, thread group will be main.
   
   Thread[main, 5, main]
